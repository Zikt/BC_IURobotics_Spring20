"""Run few replications of the experiment by using different seeds (integer numbers). You
can use the pre-prepared acrobot.ini file included in the ./xacrobot directory. While the program is
running check the source code of the environment available from the https://gym.openai.com/envs/
website to figure out the content of the observation vectors, the content of the action vector, and the
way in which the reward is calculated. Plot performance across generations and then observe the
behavior of evolved robots."""
